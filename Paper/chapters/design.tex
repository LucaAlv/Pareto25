\subsection{TWFE}
\subsubsection{Empirical Strategy}
To identify the medium run effect of extreme events on in-and out migration in Mexican municipality this seminar paper uses a municipality level panel data design. This approach exploits variation in exposure to extreme climate events within municipalities over time, while controlling for unobserved long-term heterogeneity across municipalities and common shocks across time periods.\\

The core identification strategy relies on a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) panel regression, where migration outcomes are regressed on the climate shock exposure variable. The main motivatino for choosing the TWFE-regression model stems from two major concerns for the validity of the identifcation strategy. Firstly, municipalities likely follow nation-wide long-run economic or demographic trajectories that could correlate with climate exposure and migration patterns, leading to omitted variables bias in the estimated coefficients. This is addressed by including municipality fixed effects ($\rho_t$) that capture any such national-level trends. Secondly, there may be time-invariant differences across municipalities, concerning mainly geographic and long-term climate exposure factors. This is addressed by including municipality fixed effects ($\mu$) that capture any such time-invariant factors.\\

The unit of analysis are municipality-period observations, where periods correspond to three five-year census intervals (2005-2010, 2010-2015 and 2015-2020). This extended time period allows the estimation of coefficients that are independent of cyclical trends. As outlined in section 2.1. the migration outcomes are constructed by aggregating origin-destination flows from Mexican census micro data into municipality-level measures of in-, out- and net-migration. The climate data that is originally observed in smaller time intervals is aggregated to fit the five-year periods of the census, to ensure appropriate temporal alignment with the migration data.

\subsubsection{Identification Strategy}
The main estimating regression is the following two-way-fixed-effects model:
$$Migration_{it} = \beta\text{ClimateShock}_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \mu_i + \rho_t + \epsilon_{it}$$
where $migration_{it}$ are the migration-outcomes for municipality i in period t,  $ClimateShock_{it}$ is the continuous climate shock variable, indicating the amount of extreme weather events, $X_{it}$ is a vector of time-varying controls including population size, income, age, literacy and crime, $\mu_i$ are municipality fixed effects that capture time-invariant local characteristics like geography and long-run climate risks, $\rho_t$ are period (5-year) fixed effects that capture national-level trends in migration, overall economic conditions and policy that affects all municipalities and $\epsilon_{it}$ is an idiosyncratic error term.

Standard errors are clustered at the municipality level to account for serial correlation in climate exposure and migration outcomes within municipalities across time periods. Allowing and controlling for both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation within municipalities (across time) ensures that standard errors are not underestimated. In addition Table X reports results with Standard Errors computed using Conley (1999) to account for spatial correlation in the error term across neighboring municipalities. This might be relevant, since large scale extreme weather events (such as tropical cyclones) often disrupt regional (not only municipal) outcomes. Migration responses to these disasters might thus exhibit spillover effects because of e.g. shared labor markets or infrastructure across municipality borders. 

\subsubsection{Key identifying assumptions}

The key identifying assumption for the TWFE-model outlined above is that, conditional on the fixed effects and observed controls, extreme weather exposure within municipalities is exogenous to other time-varying municipality-level factors that affect migration patterns. Formally this means: $$E[\epsilon_{it}|X_{i1},...,X_{iT},\alpha{i},\gamma{t}]$$ 
Specifically, the model assumes that there are no unobserved shocks that both vary over time within municipalities and are correlated with disaster occurrence. Examples where this could be violated are policy changes in municipalities that improve their capacity of handling extreme weather events or investment in preventive measures. In words of the classical parallel trends assumption this means that municipalities, that experienced more or fewer extreme weather events in a given year would have had the same migration outcomes as other municipalities without these extreme weather events. 

It should be noted that, the approach outlined above differs significantly from the standard TWFE approach with a binary treatment variable, that unless very strict criteria are met, suffers from negative weighting problems and bias (Goodman-Bacon 2021). In standard TWFE models treatment is usually binary and represents the occurrence of a one-time shock. The treatment used in this paper is modeling climate exposure as a (quasi-) continuous and recurrent shock-variable, greatly mitigating the concerns related to heterogeneous treatment timing in different geographic regions. 

Although the usual concerns about bias do not directly apply here, the estimates should be interpreted as reduced-form effects that capture the combined influence of the actual direct physical risk of the climate events, economic losses and also indirect social responses to climate shocks. Although information about the reason for migration is provided for some iterations of the mexican census, the amount of observations where this was actually reported do not provide enough statistical power for estimation. 

One of the issues that is due to the periodical nature of census-migration data is that the disaster data has to be aggregated to five year intervals. This makes interpretation more difficult, as the data only provides information about how migration and disasters happened "sometime in the last five years", not when exactly. A tropical storm towards the end of a time period could for example have considerable consequences for migration in the next time period. Firstly, the interpretation of the coefficients should be seen as capturing the average medium-run effects of disasters on migration, rather than short-term effects. Secondly, by shifting the time periods to which disasters are assigned to provide an additional robustness check.
